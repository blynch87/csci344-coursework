Please answer the following two questions:

1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?

It allows tables connect to eachother and communicate values.
For instance if a film table only has a category_id column but you
want to print all the movies with the actual name of the category
instead of the number associated with it, you could join it with
a category table which has a category_name column corresponding to 
the category_id.



2. Consider the structure of the posts table: 
why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the 
users table instead of storing the username, first_name, 
and last_name in the posts table?

Because that information is already stored in the users table.
Storing the same data like that in multiple tables would make the 
data set unnecessarily larger. This also defeats the purpose of having
multiple tables in the first place. Without multiple tables, the data
would become unorganized and difficult to manage.

and

"Suppose a user changes their name or username. If it's stored in multiple places:

    Youâ€™d have to update every post manually.

    If you forget or miss some, your data becomes inconsistent.

With a user_id foreign key:

    You only update the info once in the users table.

    All posts still point to the correct user."
